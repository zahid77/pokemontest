# Random-Pokemon-Generator

This readme will be updated soon.

After some tests, the changes will be merged into the main branch and a wiki for the api will be added.


This is the source code for [randompokemon.com](https://randompokemon.com). To set it up in your own environment, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download and unzip the [sprites](https://randompokemon.com/sprites/sprites.zip) into a `sprites` folder within the cloned repository.
3. Use any local web serverâ€”it's all static.
